### text_generator
This program constructs a character-level sequence model to generate text according to a character distribution learned from the dataset.

- Trained model files are available at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mvenouziou/text_generator.

Model is coded based on techniques from Imperial College London's Coursera course, "Customising your models with Tensorflow 2" (https://www.coursera.org/learn/customising-models-tensorflow2) and the Tensorflow RNN text generation documentation (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/text_generation?hl=en). Web app built on the Anvil platform
