


    When the nightingale to his mate
    Sings day-long and night late
    My love and I keep state
      In bower,
      In flower,
      ’Till the watchman on the tower
      Cry:
        “Up! Thou rascal, Rise,
        I see the white
              Light
              And the night
                          Flies.”




    O Plasmatour and true celestial light,
    Lord powerful, engirdled all with might,
    Give my good-fellow aid in fools’ despite
    Who stirs not forth this night,
                                And day comes on.

    “Sst! my good fellow, art awake or sleeping?
    Sleep thou no more. I see the star upleaping
    That hath the dawn in keeping,
                              And day comes on!

    “Hi! Harry, hear me, for I sing aright
    Sleep not thou now, I hear the bird in flight
    That plaineth of the going of the night,
                                And day comes on!

    “Come now! Old swenkin! Rise up, from thy bed,
    I see the signs upon the welkin spread,
    If thou come not, the cost be on thy head.
                                And day comes on!

    “And here I am since going down of sun,
    And pray to God that is St. Mary’s son,
    To bring thee safe back, my companion.
                                And day comes on.

    “And thou out here beneath the porch of stone
    Badest me to see that a good watch was done,
    And now thou’lt none of me, and wilt have none
                                    Of song of mine.”


    “Wait, my good fellow. For such joy I take
    With her venust and noblest to my make
    To hold embraced, and will not her forsake
    For yammer of the cuckold,
                            Though day break.”
                            




    When the springtime is sweet
    And the birds repeat
    Their new song in the leaves,
    ’Tis meet
    A man go where he will.

    But from where my heart is set
    No message I get;
    My heart all wakes and grieves;
    Defeat
    Or luck, I must have my fill.

    Our love comes out
    Like the branch that turns about
    On the top of the hawthorne,
    With frost and hail at night
    Suffers despite
    ’Till the sun come, and the green leaf on the bough.

    I remember the young day
    When we set strife away,
    And she gave me such gesning,
    Her love and her ring:
    God grant I die not by any man’s stroke
    ’Till I have my hand ’neath her cloak.

    I care not for their clamour
    Who have come between me and my charmer,
    For I know how words run loose,
    Big talk and little use.
    Spoilers of pleasure,
    We take their measure.

_Descant on a Theme by Cerclamon_

    When the sweet air goes bitter,
    And the cold birds twitter
    Where the leaf falls from the twig,
    I sough and sing
                  that Love goes out
            Leaving me no power to hold him.

    Of love I have naught
    Save troubles and sad thought,
    And nothing is grievous
                      as I desirous,
    Wanting only what
    No man can get or has got.

    With the noblest that stands in men’s sight,
    If all the world be in despite
              I care not a glove.
    Where my love is, there is a glitter of sun;
    God give me life, and let my course run
              ’Till I have her I love
              To lie with and prove.

    I do not live, nor cure me,
    Nor feel my ache--great as it is,
    For love will give
                      me no respite,
    Nor do I know when I turn left or right
                                    nor when I go out.
            For in her is all my delight
            And all that can save me.

    I shake and burn and quiver
    From love, awake and in swevyn,
    Such fear I have she deliver
                              me not from pain,
              Who know not how to ask her;
              Who can not.
    Two years, three years I seek
    And though I fear to speak out,
              Still she must know it.

    If she won’t have me now, Death is my portion,
            Would I had died that day
            I came into her sway.
    God! How softly this kills!
    When her love look steals on me.
    Killed me she has, I know not how it was,
            For I would not look on a woman.

    Joy I have none, if she make me not mad
            Or set me quiet, or bid me chatter.
    Good is it to me if she flout
            Or turn me inside out, and about.
            My ill doth she turn sweet.
        How swift it is.
            For I am traist and loose,
            I am true, or a liar,
            All vile, or all gentle,
            Or shaking between,
                                as she desire,
    I, Cerclamon, sorry and glad,
            The man whom love had
                                      and has ever;
            Alas! who’er it please or pain,
            She can me retain.

    I am gone from one joy,
    From one I loved never so much,
            She by one touch
            Reft me away;
            So doth bewilder me
            I can not say my say
                                  nor my desire,
    And when she looks on me
    It seems to me
                    I lose all wit and sense.

    The noblest girls men love
    ’Gainst her I prize not as a glove
    Worn and old.
    Though the whole world run rack
    And go dark with cloud,
    Light is
    Where she stands,
    And a clamour loud
                      in my ears.





    For three years, out of key with his time,
    He strove to resuscitate the dead art
    Of poetry; to maintain “the sublime”
    In the old sense. Wrong from the start--

    No, hardly but, seeing he had been born
    In a half savage country, out of date;
    Bent resolutely on wringing lilies from the acorn;
    Capaneus; trout for factitious bait;

    Ἵδυεν λάρ τοι πάνθ’, ὃς’ ἐνἰ Τροίη
    Caught in the unstopped ear;
    Giving the rocks small lee-way
    The chopped seas held him, therefore, that year.

    His true Penelope was Flaubert,
    He fished by obstinate isles;
    Observed the elegance of Circe’s hair
    Rather than the mottoes on sun-dials.

    Unaffected by “the march of events,”
    He passed from men’s memory in _l’an trentiesme
    De son eage_; the case presents
    No adjunct to the Muses’ diadem.



    The age demanded an image
    Of its accelerated grimace,
    Something for the modern stage,
    Not, at any rate, an Attic grace;

    Not, not certainly, the obscure reveries
    Of the inward gaze;
    Better mendacities
    Than the classics in paraphrase!

    The “age demanded” chiefly a mould in plaster,
    Made with no loss of time,
    A prose kinema, not, not assuredly, alabaster
    Or the “sculpture” of rhyme.




    The tea-rose tea-gown, etc.
    Supplants the mousseline of Cos,
    The pianola “replaces”
    Sappho’s barbitos.

    Christ follows Dionysus,
    Phallic and ambrosial
    Made way for macerations;
    Caliban casts out Ariel.

    All things are a flowing,
    Sage Heracleitus says;
    But a tawdry cheapness
    Shall outlast our days.

    Even the Christian beauty
    Defects--after Samothrace;
    We see τὀ καλόν
    Decreed in the market place.

    Faun’s flesh is not to us,
    Nor the saint’s vision.
    We have the press for wafer;
    Franchise for circumcision.

    All men, in law, are equals.
    Free of Peisistratus,
    We choose a knave or an eunuch
    To rule over us.

    O bright Apollo,
    τίν’ ἀνδρα, τίν’ ήρωά, τίνα θεὀν,
    Shall I place a tin wreath upon!




    These fought in any case,
    and some believing, pro domo, in any case ...

    Some quick to arm,
    some for adventure,
    some from fear of weakness,
    some from fear of censure,
    some for love of slaughter, in imagination,
    learning later ...

    some in fear, learning love of slaughter;
    Died some pro patria, non dulce non et decor” ...
    walked eye-deep in hell
    believing in old men’s lies, then unbelieving
    came home, home to a lie,
    home to many deceits,
    home to old lies and new infamy;
    usury age-old and age-thick
    and liars in public places.

    Daring as never before, wastage as never before.
    Young blood and high blood,
    Fair cheeks, and fine bodies;

    fortitude as never before

    frankness as never before,
    disillusions as never told in the old days,
    hysterias, trench confessions,
    laughter out of dead bellies.




    There died a myriad,
    And of the best, among them,
    For an old bitch gone in the teeth,
    For a botched civilization,

    Charm, smiling at the good mouth,
    Quick eyes gone under earth’s lid,

    For two gross of broken statues,
    For a few thousand battered books.






    Gladstone was still respected,
    When John Ruskin produced
    “Kings’ Treasuries”; Swinburne
    And Rossetti still abused.

    Fœtid Buchanan lifted up his voice
    When that faun’s head of hers
    Became a pastime for
    Painters and adulterers.

    The Burne-Jones cartons
    Have preserved her eyes;
    Still, at the Tate, they teach
    Cophetua to rhapsodize;

    Thin like brook-water,
    With a vacant gaze.
    The English Rubaiyat was still-born
    In those days.

    The thin, clear gaze, the same
    Still darts out faun-like from the half-ruin’d face,
    Questing and passive....
    “Ah, poor Jenny’s case” ...

    Bewildered that a world
    Shows no surprise
    At her last maquero’s
    Adulteries.




    Beneath the sagging roof
    The stylist has taken shelter,
    Unpaid, uncelebrated,
    At last from the world’s welter

    Nature receives him,
    With a placid and uneducated mistress
    He exercises his talents
    And the soil meets his distress.

    The haven from sophistications and contentions
    Leaks through its thatch;
    He offers succulent cooking;
    The door has a creaking latch.



        Habits of mind and feeling,
        Possibly. But in Ealing
        With the most bank-clerkly of Englishmen?

    No, “Milésian” is an exaggeration.
    No instinct has survived in her
    Older than those her grandmother
    Told her would fit her station.


    Drifted ... drifted precipitate,
    Asking time to be rid of....
    Of his bewilderment; to designate
    His new found orchid....

    To be certain ... certain ...
    (Amid ærial flowers) ... time for arrangements--
    Drifted on
    To the final estrangement;
    Unable in the supervening blankness
    To sift TO AGATHON from the chaff
    Until he found his seive....
    Ultimately, his seismograph:

    --Given that is his “fundamental passion”
    This urge to convey the relation
    Of eye-lid and cheek-bone
    By verbal manifestations;

    To present the series
    Of curious heads in medallion--

    He had passed, inconscient, full gaze,
    The wide-banded irises
    And botticellian sprays implied
    In their diastasis;

    Which anæsthesis, noted a year late,
    And weighed, revealed his great affect,
    (Orchid), mandate
    Of Eros, a retrospect.


    Mouths biting empty air,
    The still stone dogs,
    Caught in metamorphosis, were
    Left him as epilogues.




“THE AGE DEMANDED”




    For this agility chance found
    Him of all men, unfit
    As the red-beaked steeds of
    The Cytheræan for a chain bit.

    The glow of porcelain
    Brought no reforming sense
    To his perception
    Of the social inconsequence.

    Thus, if her colour
    Came against his gaze,
    Tempered as if
    It were through a perfect glaze

    He made no immediate application
    Of this to relation of the state
    To the individual, the month was more temperate
    Because this beauty had been.


                  The coral isle, the lion-coloured sand
                  Burst in upon the porcelain revery:
                  Impetuous troubling
                  Of his imagery.



    Mildness, amid the neo-Neitzschean clatter,
    His sense of graduations,
    Quite out of place amid
    Resistance to current exacerbations,
    Invitation, mere invitation to perceptivity
    Gradually led him to the isolation
    Which these presents place
    Under a more tolerant, perhaps, examination.

    By constant elimination
    The manifest universe
    Yielded an armour
    Against utter consternation,

    A Minoan undulation,
    Seen, we admit, amid ambrosial circumstances
    Strengthened him against
    The discouraging doctrine of chances,

    And his desire for survival,
    Faint in the most strenuous moods,
    Became an Olympian _apathein_
    In the presence of selected perceptions.

    A pale gold, in the aforesaid pattern,
    The unexpected palms
    Destroying, certainly, the artist’s urge,
    Left him delighted with the imaginary
    Audition of the phantasmal sea-surge,

    Incapable of the least utterance or composition,
    Emendation, conservation of the “better tradition”
    Refinement of medium, elimination of superfluities,
    August attraction or concentration.

    Nothing, in brief, but maudlin confession
    Irresponse to human aggression,
    Amid the precipitation, down-float
    Of insubstantial manna,
    Lifting the faint susurrus
    Of his subjective hosannah.

    Ultimate affronts to human redundancies;

    Non-esteem of self-styled “his betters”
    Leading, as he well knew,
    To his final
    Exclusion from the world of letters.





    Scattered Moluccas
    Not knowing, day to day,
    The first day’s end, in the next noon;
    The placid water
    Unbroken by the Simoon;

    Thick foliage
    Placid beneath warm suns,
    Tawn fore-shores
    Washed in the cobalt of oblivions;

    Or through dawn-mist
    The grey and rose
    Of the juridical
    Flamingoes;

    A consciousness disjunct,
    Being but this overblotted
    Series
    Of intermittences;
    Coracle of Pacific voyages,
    The unforecasted beach:
    Then on an oar
    Read this:

    “I was
    And I no more exist;
    Here drifted
    An hedonist.”




MEDALLION


    Luini in porcelain!
    The grand piano
    Utters a profane
    Protest with her clear soprano.

    The sleek head emerges
    From the gold-yellow frock
    As Anadyomene in the opening
    Pages of Reinach.

    Honey-red, closing the face-oval,
    A basket-work of braids which seem as if they were
    Spun in King Minos’ hall
    From metal, or intractable amber;

    The face-oval beneath the glaze,
    Bright in its suave bounding-line, as,
    Beneath half-watt rays,
    The eyes turn topaz.
